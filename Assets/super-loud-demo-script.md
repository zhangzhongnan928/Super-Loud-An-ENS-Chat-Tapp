# Super Loud Demo Video Script

## 1. Introduction (15 seconds)

Hello, I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to introduce you to Super Loud, a revolutionary Tapp (Token as Application) built on ENS name NFTs.

## 2. What is Super Loud? (30 seconds)

Super Loud is a cross-platform mini-app that turns your ENS name into a powerful communication and social networking tool. It's not just an app – it's a Tapp, which means it goes wherever your ENS token goes. Whether you're on Twitter, Telegram, or your favorite wallet, Super Loud is right there with your ENS name, ready to use.

## 3. Key Features Demo (60-90 seconds)

Let me show you how Super Loud works:

[Screen recording or live demonstration]

First, let's access Super Loud from Twitter. See how it appears right in the tweet? Now, let's switch to Telegram. The same interface, same functionality, but a different platform.

Now, let's send a friend request. I'll attach some ETH to make it interesting. [Demonstrate the process]

Once the request is accepted, we can start chatting. All messages are end-to-end encrypted for maximum security. [Show the messaging interface]

Every time you make a connection, you earn Super Loud Tokens or SLT. [Display the token reward notification]

## 4. Technical Overview (30-45 seconds)

What makes this possible is the power of the Tapp framework. We've implemented ERC-7738 for permissionless script registry and used TokenScript to define Super Loud's behavior and interface.

We've built on the Base blockchain for efficient, low-cost transactions. And the best part? The cross-platform compatibility is automatic. Build once, run anywhere – that's the beauty of Tapps.

## 5. Use Cases and Benefits (30 seconds)

Imagine the possibilities: secure, decentralized social networking, a new way to monetize your ENS name, or even a platform for decentralized governance using SLT tokens.

Super Loud doesn't just use your ENS name – it brings it to life, adding layers of utility and interactivity that weren't possible before.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Plans (15-30 seconds)

Super Loud is more than just an app – it's a glimpse into the future of web3 social interaction. We're excited about what's next: we're planning to introduce group chats, NFT sharing capabilities, and even more ways to earn and use SLT tokens.

Thank you for watching, and we can't wait to see how you'll use Super Loud to bring your ENS name to life!
